  # Professional Read Me Generator 

# ReadMe Generator

## Description
This is designed to make creating a ReadMe for coding projects a breeze. Once index.js is run by node, the user is prompted with prompts to answer that fill in a quality and detailed readMe. A readMe follows the same template no matter the project, and this ensures no sections are missed and everything is presented in a sighly and efficient format. Some challenges that I observed were getting the license badges images. I just didn't know where to start but ended up finding a solution using Shield.io eventually. Getting the readMe to be formatted the way I like was also tricky and took me a minute to figure out how to space objects appropriately.
